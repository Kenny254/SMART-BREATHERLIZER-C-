# SMART-BREATHERLIZER-C-
This is a project to build an arduino Breathalyzer that sends test receipts to main office to curb on corruption.


The MQ-3 gas sensor uses a small heater inside with an electro-chemical sensor. It is used indoors at room temperature. It can be calibrated more or less but a know concentration of the measured gas or gasses is needed for that. The output is an analog signal and can be read with an analog input of the Arduino. In this tutorial I use the “MQ-3 Alcohol Ethanol Sensor Breath Gas Detection Module For Arduino” on a breadboard-friendly breakout board.

This alcohol sensor is suitable for detecting alcohol concentration on your breath, just like your common breathalyzer. It has a high sensitivity and fast response time. Sensor provides an analog resistive output based on alcohol concentration. The drive circuit is very simple, all it needs is one resistor. A simple interface could be a 0-3.3V ADC.
