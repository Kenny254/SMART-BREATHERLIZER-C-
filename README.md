# SMART-BREATHERLIZER-C-
This is a project to build an arduino Breathalyzer that sends test receipts to main office to curb on corruption.


The MQ-3 gas sensor uses a small heater inside with an electro-chemical sensor. It is used indoors at room temperature. It can be calibrated more or less but a know concentration of the measured gas or gasses is needed for that. The output is an analog signal and can be read with an analog input of the Arduino. In this tutorial I use the “MQ-3 Alcohol Ethanol Sensor Breath Gas Detection Module For Arduino” on a breadboard-friendly breakout board.
